      "Steps: to make ghee: put the butter in a good saucepan and bring to a boil on medium heat then reduce to low now this is what will happen as the butter slowly simmers moisture will be evaporated out of the ghee the white protein-solids from the butter will sink down to the bottom of the pan and slowly turn golden a foam will rise to the surface , and as it cooks will form a bit of a crust the butter will cook into a gold color as well , and it will have a slightly nutty smell when the moisture is gone , the ghee is done decant the oil and save the delicious golden buttery bits on the bottom of the pan for toast , or mixed with veggies or potatoes if you've used salted butter , you don't want to use it on toast- the salt will knock you out , but it's still good in potatoes or whatnot making the scented syrup: combine sugar and water and bring to a boil for 3 minutes remove from heat and add rose water or essence traditional method: use a heavy-bottomed pan because the milk will stick use a non-stick pot if you have it boil the milk down over medium heat , while stirring , until it forms a paste add the flour and mix into a smooth paste oil your hands and roll them into uniform balls , place them onto a buttered plate and set aside powdered-milk method: combine the warm milk and ghee together mix the powdered milk and flour together and sprinkle slowly into the wet mix to form a dough oil your hands and form uniform balls and set aside on a buttered plate cooking the jamuns: this is the most delicate part of the operation gentle , low heat is a must use a wok or karai for best results , with the ghee about 2 5-3 inches in depth heat the ghee on low to 215 degrees slip in the balls , one by one they will sink no touching at this point gently shake the pan to move the balls and keep them from getting too brown on one side after about 5 minutes they will begin to float you will notice them getting bigger now , use a wooden spoon or equivalent to gently agitate and keep them evenly browning the ghee will slowly get hotter as the balls cook after about 20 minutes , the ghee will have risen in temperature to around 245 degrees and the balls should be nice and golden remove a ball and put it in the syrup if it doesn't collapse after 3 minutes , remove the others and add to the syrup if it does collapse , fry for another 5 minutes and try again let soak for 2 hours at least before serving serve room temperature or warmed up enjoy your gulab jamuns !\n",

Piggy Piggy, another hit. thanks Hello Tebo This was great, I did add about 1/2 c. frozen peas and 4 squirts of hot sauce, and topped with homemade seasoned bread crumbs. It was quick and easy not many dishes and so yummy.\\r\\nThanks so much, its a keeper.\\r\\nDancer^ My husband wanted something a little different, so I choose this recipe. I am sorry but we found very greasey and the sherry over powered the chicken. Thanks for posting tho. This was fantastic, I made it for guests last night and they loved it.\\nI never changed a thing. I found it very easy to make. It was served with a large garden salad with balsamic dressing, and crusty rolls.\\nThanks Miss Anne its a keeper. Thanks for suggesting this. I was one of our meat casseroles for the dinner party. Our friend  Gary almost wouldn\\'t let anyone else have any. He said it reminded him of one his mother used to make. I did make 1 change, I used a combination of cheese crackers and saltines. I also used fresh mushrooms. I was fantastic. Thanks so much. Its a keeper. Thanks Mean you got great reviews from our guests, they all wanted the recipe. I made it exactly as stated..no need to change a thing. We served it with fluffy white rice and a small salad. Thanks Mean great recipe. 5 stars is just not enough for this one.'"
